In React Router Dom v6, attempting to access the 
`useParams()` hook outside of a component using the `<Route>` or `<Routes>` component leads to unexpected behavior or errors.  The `useParams` hook is designed to work within the route component's scope, and attempting to use it elsewhere will result in `undefined` being returned. This often happens when developers try to use it in a parent component that renders multiple routes.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
function MyComponent() {
  const params = useParams(); // This will always be undefined outside of a Route component
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Parameter value: {params.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
